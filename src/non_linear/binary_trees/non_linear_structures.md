# Trees
## Definitions:
- Node -> individual elements of 
- Root -> 
- Child -> 
- Leaf -> a node without children

## Application of Binary Search Trees
- Representing hierarchical data..
- Autocompletion, eg chrome history is stored in a tree...
- Database, for indexing to quickly lookup data ...

## Operations of Trees and Their Run time complexities
### Binary Search Trees
#### Properties
- root node is always greater left child, but less than the right child.
- left node < right node
- Search -> O(log n)
- Insert -> O(log n)
- Delete -> O(log n)
## Traversing a tree
### Breadth First | Level Order Traversal
-  Visit all the nodes at the same level before visting the nodes on the next level.
### Depth First
- Pre-order:- Root, Left, Right
- In-Order:  Left Root Right
- Post-Order: Right Left Root
