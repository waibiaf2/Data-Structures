# Linked Lists
- Node -> has a value and a pointer to the next node
- Each node is a separate object

## Complexity
- Access: O(n)
- Search: O(n)
- Insertion: 
  - At end -> O(1) 
  - At beginning -> O(1)
  - In middle -> O(n)
- Deletion: 
  - At end -> O(n)
  - At beginning -> O(1)
  - In middle -> O(n)

## Types of Linked Lists
- Singly Linked List -> Node has a pointer to the next node
- Doubly Linked List -> Node has a pointer to the next and previous node
